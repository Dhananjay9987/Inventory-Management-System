# Project Title:
Inventory Management System with GUI using Python

# Problem Statement:
In small businesses or personal setups, tracking stock items manually becomes inefficient
and error-prone. This project aims to build a simple, user-friendly inventory management
tool with a graphical interface that allows non-technical users to manage stock efficiently.

# Project Overview:
This is a desktop-based Inventory Management System built using Python's Tkinter GUI
library. It enables users to add, update, delete, search, and export inventory items. The
application also displays all items in a live-updating table and allows exporting the inventory
to a .csv file for backup or further analysis.

# Key Features:
• Add Items: Add new items with name, quantity, and price.
• Update Items: Modify existing item details (quantity or price).
• Search Items: Retrieve and autofill item details in the form.
• Delete Items: Remove items from the inventory.
• Export to CSV: Save inventory data to a .csv file with quantity × price totals.
• Live Table View: Inventory table updates instantly on every action.
• Form Validation: Prevents invalid or incomplete inputs using input checks and pop-
up messages.

# Technologies Used:
1. Tool/Tech Purpose
2. Python 3 Core programming language
3. Tkinter GUI development
4. CSV module Exporting inventory data
5. Tool/Tech Purpose
6. ttk.Treeview Displaying tabular data in the GUI

# Logic and Functionality:
• All inventory data is stored temporarily in a Python dictionary (inventory = {}), where
each key is an item name and the value is a dictionary containing quantity and price.
• Form inputs are validated before any action is performed (e.g., checking if price is a
number, quantity is an integer, and all fields are filled).
• GUI components like Entry, Label, and Button are used to interact with the user.
• A Treeview widget is used to render a live table view that refreshes after every
inventory operation.
• The "Export CSV" button writes all inventory data to a inventory_export.csv file.

# What You Learned:
• How to build a real-world GUI using Tkinter
• Data structure handling using dictionaries
• Input validation and user interaction with pop-up messages
• How to use Treeview for dynamic table rendering
• File operations for exporting data (csv.writer)
• GUI application design patterns and event-driven programming
